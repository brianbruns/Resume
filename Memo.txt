I didn't learn a ton from the assignment, as I had worked with a configuration management 
system a lot through my co-op, but it put into words and explained a lot of 
practices I had seen and been using without knowing it. The biggest of which is learning 
about the terminology used within configuration management systems. Something like change
control was a concept I understood and tried to follow because it was valuable, but
never got a clear explanation as to why.

I had never really used Github a bunch prior, as my co-op used TFS, but the contribution page
seemed to be incredibly helpful for tracking progress. I had seen it before on the 
Internet where people talk about project burnout and how much their productivity
dropped with their passion fading, but learning specifically how it was tracked and how 
teams use it was nice to learn. Another thing I learned that was actually new to me
was versioning in the filenames of your files. We used a git repository through TFS, and 
we changed version numbers on releases, but not within files. We typically tracked different 
versions through branching off from the master branch and other software that tracked
changes throughout the program.

Overall, configuration management is really important when there's one person working on the
project, but especially so when there's multiple. Being able to have accountability
within software development is crucial. Just being able to learn about who wrote what,
and being able to ask questions about their thought process is invaluable to your own understanding
of the functionality of what you're working on.
